        "Hi! My name's Tory, and I am currently a Junior at THE Ohio State University 
        majoring in Computer Science and Engineering. My journey into the world of Computer Science 
        began back in my sophomore year of high school. Since then, my passion for the field 
        has only grown, propelling me towards further exploration and learning. 
        I always look forward to learning new languages and technologies, acquiring new skills, facing new challenges, 
        and meeting new people with the continuous goal of bettering myself and one day developing 
        something revolutionary. Explore this website to learn more about me and get in contact !! :)"
